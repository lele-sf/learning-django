# Learning Django

Welcome to my repository for learning Django! This repository serves as a journal of my journey as I explore the Django web framework and Django Rest Framework (DRF). I'm documenting my progress, notes, and projects from various sources, including online courses, documentation, and tutorials.

## Courses

### Curso de Django Web Framework e Django Rest Framework (DRF) by Luiz OtÃ¡vio Miranda

- [Course Link](https://www.udemy.com/course/curso-de-django-web-framework-com-python-html-e-css/)
 This course is my primary resource for learning Django and DRF. I'll be following along with the lessons, completing exercises, and building projects to reinforce my understanding.

## Additional Resources

- [Django Documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/): The official documentation for Django provides comprehensive guides, tutorials, and references for every aspect of the framework.

- [Django For Everybody](https://youtu.be/o0XbHvKxw7Y?si=1BjyS3URekqFq7L0): This YouTube series by Dr. Charles Severance offers practical tutorials and examples for beginners to learn Django.

## Projects

This repository contains projects and exercises from various sources, including courses, tutorials, and personal experiments. Here's a brief overview of the projects included:

- **Project 1/Recipes**: The Django Recipe Application is a web platform built with Django, aimed at enabling recipe sharing and exploration. It includes features like secure user authentication, recipe posting with admin approval, and recipe browsing for visitors. The project serves as a practical application of Django and potentially DRF studies, with ongoing updates and enhancements planned for the repository.

## Study Notes

I maintain detailed study notes in the `study_notes.md` file. These notes include summaries of concepts, code snippets, and insights gained during my learning process.

Feel free to explore the repository, review the projects, and follow along with my learning journey. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to reach out!

Happy coding! ðŸš€
